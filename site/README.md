<h1> TakeALookInside </h1>
<h2> Lightweight webapp HTML5 application </h2>


This is the same code as in the app directory but with less features and all code which calls native methods is removed.

It's used as a mobile webapp, it provides support for scanning QR-codes for people who don't have the application installed.

If a user scans a QR-code that belongs to this app, it shows the map and the popup of the scanned building. They cannot 
watch the movie but a downloadlink to the app is provided, in order to be able to download the app and watch the movie.

In the app all functionality is available, in the webapp, most of it is disable.
It is not possible to:
- watch movies
- like/favorite
- no home screen with top must sees, favorites, seen, look later
